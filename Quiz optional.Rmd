## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This quiz is meant to help you synthesize materials we've covered in class. If you'd prefer to use other functions, that's okay too. 
You should see the following variables: 
subj- subject number
condition- experimental or control
stroop- an accuracy score for the stroop task (30 trials)
nback- an accuracy score for the n back task (recalling a number/object a given number of trials back;50 trials)
ravens- score on raven's progressive matrices (25 trials)

People are assigned to either complete a cognitive training task (to improve memory) or to have no training. We have

```{r}

1. Take a summary of the full dataset.
```{r}

```

2. What kind of data do you have (wide or long?). How do you know?
```{r}

```
3. Check the type of data presented in the condition column. Make sure this variable is a factor
```{r}

```

4. Create a new column called Stroop Accuracy.
Label those who have a higher than average score at t1 "high EF", those below average "low EF" and those at average "Average EF" (Note: EF stands for executive function). 
```{r}

```

5. Create a dataset containing participants' nback scores in long format. (Note: you should keep all other variables)
```{r}

```
```
6. Returning to the original dataset, create a column indicating the difference between the two ravens scores. 
```{r}

```

7. Based on #6, create two subsets of data: 1 where the ravens difference score is positive and one where it is negative
```{r}

```
